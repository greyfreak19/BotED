# ED-Bot
A Discord Bot made in python using the Discord.py API Wrapper Library by Rapptz.

Not much to see here right now as there are only a measly 3 functions and a single file.

To run the bot just doing the 'Main.py' file, add your own bot token from Discord Develepor Portal and run it .

Note: You need to have python installed to run the 'Main.py' file.

DERP...
